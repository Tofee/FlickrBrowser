FlickrBrowser
=============

FlickrBrowser in pure QML.

Usage
-----

There are several ways of executing this source code:
 * Start qml/FlickrBrowser.qml using qmlscene
 * Open the qml/FlickrBrowser.qmlproject with QtCreator, and simply start it
 * Open FlickrBrowser.pro in the root directory with QtCreator, compile the project, and start "qflickrbrowser"

Note that if the machine is behind a proxy, the 3rd method is the only solution to be able to execute the QML with the correct proxy settings.
